    <p>Rice flavoured with ground pepper and chicken stock with plain boiled chicken is a good combination of two simple tastes.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500 g Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>2 glasses of rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>1 glass of chicken stock</li>
        <li>2 glasses of boiled water</li>
        <li>1 dessertspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First, we put our chicken in the pot to boil and add water to a finger above it and let it boil.</li>
        <li>We take our boiled chicken aside to cool.</li>
        <li>We'll be raising our chickens when it's cooled down a bit.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, we put our rice in warm water and wait for the starch to come out.</li>
        <li>We add our oil to the rice pot and fry our noodles when it melts.</li>
        <li>When the color of the vermicelli changes and its smell comes out, we add our rice and fry it for another 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then we add our chicken that we mohair on our rice.</li>
        <li>After adding 1 glass of chicken broth and 2 glasses of boiled water, add salt and pepper, mix it once and leave it to cook on low heat by closing the lid. I do not mix too much while cooking rice, and I recommend it to you.</li>
        <li>When our rice absorbs its water and becomes grains, we turn off the bottom and put a paper towel on the lid to infuse. While serving, we take the towel and eat our rice with pleasure. Health to your hands.</li>
